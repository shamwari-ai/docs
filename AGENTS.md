# Documentation project instructions

## About this project

- This is a documentation site built on [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com)
- Pages are MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Configuration lives in `docs.json`
- Use the Mintlify MCP server, `https://mcp.mintlify.com`, to edit content and settings via MCP
- Use the Mintlify docs MCP server, `https://www.mintlify.com/docs/mcp`, to query information about using Mintlify via MCP

## Terminology

<!-- Add product-specific terms and preferred usage -->
<!-- Example: Use "workspace" not "project", "member" not "user" -->

## Style preferences

<!-- Add any project-specific style rules below -->

- Use active voice and second person ("you")
- Keep sentences concise — one idea per sentence
- Use sentence case for headings
- Bold for UI elements: Click **Settings**
- Code formatting for file names, commands, paths, and code references

## Content boundaries

<!-- Define what should and shouldn't be documented -->
<!-- Example: Don't document internal admin features -->

## Track big work in GitHub issues

Any substantial build, migration, investigation or multi-step task gets a GitHub issue in the repo that owns it — before or as work starts — so another session, agent or person can pick it up.

- The issue holds the goal, the owner's decisions (verbatim where given), the plan, acceptance criteria, owner-only steps and links.
- Every PR references its issue (`Refs #n`; `Fixes #n` only when the merge completes it).
- Post progress, decisions and a hand-off note (what's done, what's left, branch names) as issue comments — at each merge and before a session or agent finishes.
- Work spanning repos gets a tracking issue that links the per-repo issues.
- Never put secrets, credential status or exploitable detail in issues on public repos.

## Dev skills, progress reports and the merge gate

Load the Mzizi **dev skills** before starting work: `mzizi_get_skills category=dev` on the Mzizi MCP (`mcp.mzizi.dev`), or `@nyuchi/mzizi-skills` from npm. They are `digital-hygiene` and `progress-report`.

- **Digital hygiene.** Check free disk before starting, clone only under `$TMPDIR`, share build caches, and audit, then delete, your clones once the work merges (`digital-hygiene` skill).
- **Clone isolation.** Clone only into a directory unique to you; never touch another agent's.
- **Progress reports.** All dev work runs on a 10-minute progress-report loop (`progress-report` skill): measured bars, what changed, and a final "Needs you:" line. Report ticks never publish, release, merge or deploy without the owner's approval.
- **Merge gate.** Merge only when the work is complete, CI is green, it's verified at runtime, and `/code-review` has run with findings resolved.
