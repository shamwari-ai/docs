## Track big work in GitHub issues

Any substantial build, migration, investigation or multi-step task gets a GitHub issue in the repo that owns it — before or as work starts — so another session, agent or person can pick it up.

- The issue holds the goal, the owner's decisions (verbatim where given), the plan, acceptance criteria, owner-only steps and links.
- Every PR references its issue (`Refs #n`; `Fixes #n` only when the merge completes it).
- Post progress, decisions and a hand-off note (what's done, what's left, branch names) as issue comments — at each merge and before a session or agent finishes.
- Work spanning repos gets a tracking issue that links the per-repo issues.
- Never put secrets, credential status or exploitable detail in issues on public repos.
